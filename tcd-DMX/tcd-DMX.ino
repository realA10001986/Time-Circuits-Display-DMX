/*
 * Build instructions (for Arduino IDE)
 * 
 * - Install the Arduino IDE
 *   https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
 *    
 * - This firmware requires the "ESP32-Arduino" framework. To install this framework, 
 *   in the Arduino IDE, go to "File" > "Preferences" and add the URL   
 *   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
 *   - or (if the URL above does not work) -
 *   https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json
 *   to "Additional Boards Manager URLs". The list is comma-separated.
 *   
 * - Go to "Tools" > "Board" > "Boards Manager", then search for "esp32", and install 
 *   the latest version by Espressif Systems.
 *   Detailed instructions for this step:
 *   https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html
 *   
 * - Go to "Tools" > "Board: ..." -> "ESP32 Arduino" and select your board model (the
 *   CircuitSetup original boards are "NodeMCU-32S")
 *   
 * - Connect your ESP32 board using a suitable USB cable.
 *   Note that NodeMCU ESP32 boards come in two flavors that differ in which serial 
 *   communications chip is used: Either SLAB CP210x USB-to-UART or CH340. Installing
 *   a driver might be required.
 *   Mac: 
 *   For the SLAB CP210x (which is used by NodeMCU-boards distributed by CircuitSetup)
 *   installing a driver is required:
 *   https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads
 *   The port ("Tools -> "Port") is named /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART, and the maximum
 *   upload speed ("Tools" -> "Upload Speed") can be used.
 *   The CH340 is supported out-of-the-box since Mojave. The port is named 
 *   /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX (XXXX being some random number), and the maximum upload 
 *   speed is 460800.
 *   Windows:
 *   For the SLAB CP210x (which is used by NodeMCU-boards distributed by CircuitSetup)
 *   installing a driver is required:
 *   https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads
 *   After installing this driver, connect your ESP32, start the Device Manager, 
 *   expand the "Ports (COM & LPT)" list and look for the port with the ESP32 name.
 *   Choose this port under "Tools" -> "Port" in Arduino IDE.
 *   For the CH340, another driver is needed. Try connecting the ESP32 and have
 *   Windows install a driver automatically; otherwise search google for a suitable
 *   driver. Note that the maximum upload speed is either 115200, or perhaps 460800.
 *
 * - Install required libraries. In the Arduino IDE, go to "Tools" -> "Manage Libraries" 
 *   and install the following libraries:
 *   - esp_dmx (>= 4.0.1): https://github.com/someweisguy/esp_dmx
 *
 * - Download the complete firmware source code:
 *   Extract this file somewhere. Enter the "tcd-DMX" folder and 
 *   double-click on "tcd-DMX.ino". This opens the firmware in the
 *   Arduino IDE.
 *
 * - Go to "Sketch" -> "Upload" to compile and upload the firmware to your ESP32 board.
