The files here are fixture definitions for the TCD. 

The "Speedo" fixture is only used if speedo support is enabled.

The "Verificaion" fixture is a virtual fixture for packet verification.

"qxf" files are for QLC+ 4.x.

"hed" files are for MagicQ. This might be incomplete; all non-intensity controls have attribute "pan (4), you propably need to adapt this to your needs.
